# WASM Library Packaging Re-Export Example -- NextJS

This example demonstrates that the WASM build system works after being re-exported from a WASM library consumed by NextJS and requiring no special configuration to do so. To test, run `npm i && npm run dev` then visit `localhost:3000` to see it working! (The server-side sorting will print in the terminal).
